This repository contains the computer code (in Matlab and Singular) for all mathematical analysis, and for generating all figures, in the publication "Protein-protein complexes can undermine ultrasensitivity-dependent biological adaptation", submitted to Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Authors: Cailan Jeynes-Smith and Robyn P. Araujo, July 2021, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.

The majority of analysis was performed on data generated through the use of RandSamplingCC.m and RandSamplingMa.m for varying conditions (see code documentation), and also to genreate the 7 datasets (.mat) included in this repository.

The following scripts were used to generate figures for the above-noted publication. Specifically:

Figs 3,5,6 use SingleSimulations.m
Fig 4 uses AbundanceHeatmap.m
Figs 7,8,10 use ScatterFigures.m
Figs 9, 13 use SingleReversibleCovalentModificationCycle.m
Figs 11, 12 use ParameterHistograms.m
These five Matlab scripts generate the plots in the associated figures. In order to generate the figures in the published article, the associated function is run using the parameters identified in the caption of the relevant figure, and combined into a single figure in Powerpoint.
